# Data Structure, Algorithms in C++

It’s implied in all of the following assignments that you:
- Follow the C++ core guidelines
- Organise the code into classes, making use of RAII and writing the most clean, predictable and efficient code that you can come up with
- Have a relatively easy build process with low chances of build failure due to, say, a library not being found (look into CMake FetchContent or Conan)
- Ideally, use modern C++20 (and above) features
- Make use of generics
- Make use of multithreading techniques where you see fit
- Don’t overuse features provided by the standard library
- Don’t overcomplicate the code
- Format the code uniformly using reasonable and readable guidelines
- Use Conan or CMakeLists.txt for the project
- For the best results and the least amount of headache, we recommend using clang-tidy and clang-format.

## Location Tracking System

Write the following in C++ according to the guidelines above
1. Obtain an orderbook fetcher using websockets
2. Write a bot that uses the orderbook data to trade on any global exchange
3. Implement a trading model using Pytorch (https://pytorch.org/) and integrate it with the trading bot
4. Explain the bot architecture to us and the maximum Transaction Per Second (TPS) and Tick-to-Trade

# Assembly Language and Compiler Optimization
- Use your C++ bot
- Go to Godbolt.com
- Try to do optimization on your code and explain why

# Mathematics
- Explain in multiple paragraphs the Clay millennium problems.
- Please explain The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm: ECDSA, as mathematically thorough as possible

# Probability and Statistics
- Please derive the probability density function and cumulative probability function of a 1) Gaussian distribution 2) Poisson Distribution 3) Uniform Distribution
- Please implement the probability density function and cumulative probability function of a 1) Gaussian distribution 2) Poisson Distribution 3) Uniform Distribution in Python

# Cryptocurrencies
- Explain in your own words what are cryptocurrencies?
- Explain what is zero-knowledge proofs? Give an example of a simple ZKP.
- Why do you want to work for STG?
